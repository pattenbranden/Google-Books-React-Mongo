# Google-Books-React-Mongo

In this project I've used Mongo, Express, React, and Node.js to build my first MERN stack application.<br>
It's easily been the hardest assignment out of the bunch, but perservierance and hard work paid off.<br>

TODOs: 
- Code to prevent duplicate SAVED entries, this can be done by searching the database for the ID of the book we just hit save on, compairing any results, and either creating a new entry or alerting the user that it already exisists.<br>
- Add some CSS so it doesn't looks so.. bootstrappy.<br>
- Refactor code.
